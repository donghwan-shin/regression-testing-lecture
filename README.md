# Regression Testing in Software Reengineering

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Self-Study (before lecture)

Measure the test coverage of `prep.py`.

```bash
pytest --cov-report=html --cov=prep tests/test_prep.py 
```

Currently, the test coverage of `prep.py` is only 33%. 
Can you improve it by adding more test cases in `tests/test_prep.py`?

## Lecture

No need to do this part before the lecture.

Please follow the lecturer's lead (lecture slides will be uploaded on Blackboard).
